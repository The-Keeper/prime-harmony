          <p>
            Each season could be divided into three months, in which case we
            would get the usual 12 months, but there is no need for division, as
            the length of the seasons is the same and is conveniently divided by
            10.

        <details name="faq">
          <summary>Why no day names?</summary>
          <p>
            If 10-day weeks (decades) are used, there is little need to name the
            days of the week, as the calendar is constant and is always clear
            what day it is by the last digit.
